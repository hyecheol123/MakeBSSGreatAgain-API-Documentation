description: |
  Users have authority to help admins to identify real alumni.
  The users can cancel the upvote for the new user.
  If they want to alert admin spam/fake user, they need to use `report` features, rather than just deleting the upvote.

  If the upvotes the new user received exceed threshold, the user is considered as a verified BSS alumni.
